'''
DESCRIPTION:
This module contains the Controller which deals with read/writing to the COM port and executing commands. 

USAGE:
python controller.py -COM COM_port -i input_filename -o output_filename

NOTES:
Controller is inherets from serial.Serial

All command line arguments are optional, the default arguments are defined
at the top of this file. The input commands are assumed
to be separated by a newline character (one command per line). The output is
(command), (response)
..., ...

This file should read a csv file to get a list of serial commands, store those
in the approriate data structure, write the commands in an arbitrary order to
a specifiable COM port (default /dev/ttyUSB0), record the response in a separate
csv file, preferably also with the command that produced the response
